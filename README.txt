This solution uses an application (RetrieverApp) to get simple commands (Zip, Music and Television) to call
the respective classes.

Note that it separates the userinput into a method within the app using a method called getUserInput().
We can then use that method again to get the "subcommand", eg, the particular artist, television show or zipcode.
